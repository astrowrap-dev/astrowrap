astRowRap
=========
An umbrella package that gets together variously commonly used statistical techniques in Astrophysics and provides a pedagogical explanation of these with domain-specific datasets and examples.

Please note that astRowRap only __curates__ the different statistical algorithms. The package simply provides a one-point access to these functions which are bundled within packages on CRAN. All copyrights for these packages belong to their respective owners.
