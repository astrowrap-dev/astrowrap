Introduction
------------

astRowRap is a wrapper - an umbrella package - that gets together several statistical techniques that astronomers and astrophysicists could use. It provides a pedagogical explanation of the techniques and supplements their R packages with domain-specific datasets and examples. The basis for the package is Section 7 of the IVOA KDD Guide on Data Mining for Astronomy. 

Please note that astRowRap only __curates__ different statistical algorithms. The package simply provides a one-point access to these functions which are bundled within packages on CRAN. All copyrights for these packages belong to their respective owners.  

Installation
------------

astRowRap is currently under development and hence only available via Github. You can install it easily with the following 3 steps:
<pre>install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("astrowrap", "astrowrap-dev")
</pre>
