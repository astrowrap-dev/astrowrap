astRowRap
=========

astRowRap is a wrapper - an umbrella package - that gets together several statistical techniques that astronomers and astrophysicists could use. It provides a pedagogical explanation of the techniques and supplements their R packages with domain-specific datasets and examples.

Please note that astRowRap only __curates__ different statistical algorithms. The package simply provides a one-point access to these functions which are bundled within packages on CRAN. All copyrights for these packages belong to their respective owners.
