{"name":"astRowRap","tagline":"R wrapper for statistics in Astronomy","body":"Introduction\r\n------------\r\n\r\nastRowRap is a wrapper - an umbrella package - that gets together several statistical techniques that astronomers and astrophysicists could use. It provides a pedagogical explanation of the techniques and supplements their R packages with domain-specific datasets and examples. The basis for the package is Section 7 of the [IVOA KDD Guide on Data Mining for Astronomy](http://wiki.ivoa.net/twiki/bin/view/IVOA/IvoaKDDguideUnused). \r\n\r\nPlease note that astRowRap only __curates__ different statistical algorithms. The package simply provides a one-point access to these functions which are bundled within packages on CRAN. All copyrights for these packages belong to their respective owners.  \r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nastRowRap is currently under development and hence only available via Github. You can install it easily with the following 3 steps:\r\n<pre>install.packages(\"devtools\")\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(\"astrowrap\", \"astrowrap-dev\")\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nContact\r\n-------\r\nFor any bugs/improvements/suggestions, please email us at __astrowrap.dev@gmail.com__.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
